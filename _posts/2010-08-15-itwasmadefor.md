subtitle: At the start, every technology was made to help
date: 2010-08-15 00:00:00 +0100
category: illustration
description: Series of illustrations about why technologies were made for and how
  we actually use them.
intro: If we watch every technology, they were made for help and evolve the world.
  But if it became popular it's for bad reasons. I illustrate this with television
  (the big troyen), mobile (to say nothing interresting), internet (procratination
  world) and blogs (narcissic webpages). <br>For sure you'll recognise your-self.
quote: I've watched 63 stupid videos during this project. Damn.
