description: I can do something good from a deception, sometimes.
intro: Start of 2011, I sent some candidatures to digital agencies in London to
  see if I could get a chance to get a job. It was with a big surprise that one
  of my favourite contacted me and wanted to hire me. Unfortunately, because of
  my current contract I couldn't leave my job to accept it. <br>After this big deception,
  I created this illustration to express my mood. So finally, I can do something
  good from a deception.
