description: 'Tetris on Novation Launchpad with WebMIDI'
intro: "For Christmas, my big brother offer me the Novation Launchpad. It's beautiful piece of hardware. Despite the fact I'm not good at music and (sometimes) try to improve myself on it, I remain bad at it. However, the manufacturer provide a documentation about MIDI to communicate with the device. I cannot help it, I had to control these LEDs from my browser. Few days later, tetris was running. It was quite interesting to build a game and respect the limitation of the device to obtain a smooth game. And the best: everything is Web powered. You can see a <a href='https://twitter.com/mxwllt/status/819245451270615040'>quick demo of tetrispad</a> on my twitter."
