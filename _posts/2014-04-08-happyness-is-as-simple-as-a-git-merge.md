Not so long time ago, I've made a [post](https://maxwellito.tumblr.com/post/72909443558/batteries-sold-separately) about a fix I've done on XBMC, about the Wiimote driver. After few months, I could say : "It's working pretty well!". A complete charge can last several weeks.

Even if the 'motto' of the blog is : "I don't give a fork", I decided to do, for once.
Repo forked, new branch created, changes done and committed : press "Pull request". After some interrogations, another commit, then a squashing (I didn't even knew that on Git) and few weeks. The pull request has been finally accepted.
Apparently, the change was also fixing another issue. The driver was using 1/3 of the CPU, and now only 10%. But we need to confirm. Like my main commit.
My first, proper, pulling request on a big open source project and it's not a typo in the documentation.

Here is some reactions:
> What a jerk! He just changed 3 lines on a feature that nobody use, and he feels like a boss.

> Nobody else had this issue before, and it seems to be pretty big. Impossible, it look more like a PEBCAK to me.

> There's a built-in Wiimote driver in XBMC? That's cool. Huh? I have to pull the code, compile it, set it up to start automatically? Ok, wait, what? I have to use the terminal to do that?? Nah, I'll continue to use my smartphone as remote. That's fine.

> I'm happy for you Max, that's great! I mean, you look happy! But.. what's an XBMC, a Wiimote and a GitHub? And what did you pulled?

Just to finish on a positive message for all the noobs around the world (like me) : don't feel scared to contribute on a repo: it's easy, anybody can spot something, help is always welcome, and it's a good experience.
But let's be clear between us. Pass your time on [2048](https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) does not give you the right to say you are a '*tester on a hype open source project*'. No, just no.
