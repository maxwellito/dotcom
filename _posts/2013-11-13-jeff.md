description: 'Tribute to the famous Roy Lichtenstein canvas : "Oh Jeff..."'
intro: 50 years ago (well 49 to be correct), Roy Lichtenstein made this famous canvas
  representing a lady on the phone saying "Oh, Jeff.. I love you, too... but...".
  It become one of the most popular work about the pop-art period.<br>As a simple
  admirer, I wanted to make the 2013 version. The technology has changed, our way
  to comminucate too, but the message stay the same.
