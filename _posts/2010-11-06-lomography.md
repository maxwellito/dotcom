description: Old and vintage pictures made with lomography methods are more relevant
  than numerical pictures.
intro: After have discovered photography with digital cameras I wanted to try lomography
  methods with an old Lomo Lubitel 2 (1955).<br>It's really interesting to see how
  photography works. Manage focus and exposure, and deal with the Lubitel viewer.
  The result is not that bad for a start, I'll continue to practice.
