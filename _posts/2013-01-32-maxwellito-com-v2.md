description: 'The new version of maxellito.com. Made with Symfony and using some
  feature of HTML5/CSS3. Media Query is also part of the game: maxwellito.com say
  hello to mobile users.'
intro: Three years after launching the first version, a full rebuild was necessary.
  Flash is not friendly anymore, damn S. Jobs. So to make this a challenge I took
  the opportunity to learn Symfony, the popular PHP framework. HTML5 and CSS3, media-query
  are used to make this website available for mobile. A little refresh of the 'branding'
  was necessary, but the logo stay's the same and will always stay the same.<br>Actually,
  we keep the same crazy guy behind, the weird projects and just change the design.
  And here is the new version.
quote: After 391 differents designs, I found the good one (until tomorrow).
