One year ago, I’ve been to the Facebook office in Covent Garden, London. I was really excited to go for the first time in a giant internet company office. Even if I wasn’t (and I’m still) not fan of their policy, Facebook is the biggest social network (after pubs).

The funny thing is, this company is promoting the idea of liking and sharing. Actually without that, they would be, not-existing? And the first thing you do when you arrive is : signing a contract to not share what you’re going to do/see/hear in the building. Remarkable.

Do as I say, not as I do.
