description: Some helvetica for a bad quote on my old skateboard.
intro: After I ended my last painting I looked for a new support, and I finded my
  old skateboard. As an "helveticaddict", I painted an expression that I had in
  my head for a long time. Made with bomb-spray and a homemade stencil. I don’t
  think the sentence is written correctly in english, like this website.. (ouch!).
quote: I already fail on a skateboard. Now, I also fail on skateboard design.
