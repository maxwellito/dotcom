description: A paint about nothing and everything, that's strange but I don't know
  how to define it.
intro: After two months of work, I created a paint in black and white. I used a
  black pensil (POSCA), and I was surprised to use only one of it. It has no real
  message, just a huge mess with objects of my life and other stuff. I discovered
  how much time is required when you try to make it detailed.<br>Between dream and
  reality, me on my little cloud...   so enjoy life.
quote: No Posca pen has been abused during the production.
