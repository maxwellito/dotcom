description: 'Stop-motion video to understand the basics of WebRTC'
intro: "After playing a bit with stop motion, I wanted to build something a bit bigger. The topic was missing but it came very quickly: WebRTC. It was the first time I tried to explain something in video. It took me ages to write the storyboard, draw and cut all the different pieces, pass one complete night to take the shots then take some courage to record my voice. The result hold in 4 minutes of video. This is definitely perfectible."
