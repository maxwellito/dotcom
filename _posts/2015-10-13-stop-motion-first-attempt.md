For my [last post](https://maxwellito.tumblr.com/post/130977884131/nfc-the-killer-feature-for-chromecast) I did something I wanted to do in ages: stop motion. But I had nothing to hold my camera in the air and take pictures of my desk. This problem always blocked me to go further. Then I remembered about these old arcade games which are using a mirror inside: "Oh! There's something to try". It ended with the following set up.

A big mirror, hold by a Vans box and covered with a T-Shirt to not damage the wall. Then another box to put the camera a bit up. A bit of light, and we are good to go.

It's not really complex, and I'm quite happy of the result for a first try. There's some things I've learn and some I will do differently next time.

- Be sure the mirror angle is 45 degrees. Otherwise your picture will have a bit of perspective.
- Use a remote for your camera. The risk to move during the shoot is too high, and retake a scene is not fun.
- Define the exposure and don't change it. I made the silly mistake to leave it on automatic, which caused blinking effect.
- Better light. I thought the day light with my lamp would be enough.
- Use gel to stick element to the table, but remember to clean the marks for the next take.
- Use thick paper, mine was too thin.
- Prepare your storyboard
- Avoid stacking elements, itâ€™s a mess to move. Like the smartphone in the last part, the screen is another element. Every time I was moving the phone, the screen was going away, I should have make another smartphone with this screen.

There will be another attempt, for sure.
