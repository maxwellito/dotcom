description: 'Generate small sequence of music from commit SHA'
intro: "Long time ago I found a clone of the Tenori-On in Web. It's such a nice tool to play and make melodies but I wanted to find a source to generate the combinaisons. Until I realised commit SHA are 'unlimited' and easy to access. From a hash, the program will extract a BPM, a melody pattern and list of sound to use between the Tenori and TR808. The result is a noize generator that even the worst techno club couldn't broadcast, this is the improvement to do."
quote: A good idea badly executed remain bad.
