description: 'My personnal portfolio about artWork, photographies and websites.
  It''s the first version of maxwellito.com. By me, myself and for incomprehensible
  reasons. '
intro: 'After five thousand lines of code, four months and too many gallons of coffee:
  maxwellito.com is online!<br>End of 2009, I had the idea to make my own website,
  a simple place to put all my creations. At this moment my ''web skills'' were
  pretty bad, but I was good in ActionScript 3. So I don''t really had the choice:
  maxwellito.com was going to be in full-Flash. This also was my hidden goal of
  the website: show what I''m able to do in AS3. <br>This version has been online
  during three years.'
