description: A kind of gallery in an infinite loop. Welcome in the wallery.
intro: Wallery is a pack of PHP classes to generate a random map of pictures. You
  just give a list of picture in entry (with their dimentions) and some extra content
  if needed for the final rendering. Every page is different, because the positions
  are choosen randomly. To navigate, just move your mouse to go where you want.<br>The
  project is available on GitHub, you can go and judge my bad code.<br><br><a href="/media/wallery"
  target="_blank">Try the wallery here</a>
quote: The algorithm is the key.
