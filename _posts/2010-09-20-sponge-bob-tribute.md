description: Why a cartoon character can not be political ? So now, Sponge Bob is
  officially a communist.
intro: Why a cartoon character can not be political ?<br/>I wanted to try this mix
  since long time. It's why I have made the famous Sponge Bob on an old communist
  poster from WWII. The style come from Shepard Fairey, who know how to renew the
  propaganda style. Nobody thinks he was communist, now many people have some doubts.
