description: A simple HTML page using good CSS tricks to intruduce my-self, not
  in a conventionnal way, as usual.
intro: 'Before to move to London, I needed something to introduce my-self to recruitors
  (something better than a simple CV). A simple webpage was the most appropriate
  solution, something as weird as me. There is different points on this page: my
  dev skills, my geeky side, my pseudo creative side, my hobby for design and my
  curiosity. <br>It took me a lot of time to make these designs and illustrate my
  ideas. And everything works with HTML and CSS, the JavaScript is optional.<br><br><a
  href="/media/aboutMe" target="_blank">The ''aboutMe'' page is available here</a>'
