description: 'Series of illustrations made with triangles. '
intro: 'The idea was simple, working with the main shape : the triangle. At the
  start it was used to make the background of a simple flyer called "It''s always
  difficult to ask something important". The concept was easy to workout so I tried
  to take this to an other level: make the portrait of a friend (the FAITH illustration).
  For once I was happy to use a big range of colours; I used to stay on basic colours,
  or even no colour at all. It takes a lot of time to build something from a superposition
  of triangles. <br>The ''Justice'' illustration is monochrome (go back to the basics)
  and about my favourite band. Something simple, the color of the band and the atmosphere
  of their live performance'
quote: Easy and colorfull, I love triangles.
