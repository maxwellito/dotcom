I think to not be the only one in this case. The typical problem of having logos in black and white while you need them in transparent. Photoshop can be a friend but this is pointless sometimes, it keep a sharpened border or a bit of grayscale.

Grrr... (please insert any bad words here)

Then I realised JavaScript and canvas could help me. It’s a simple web page where you drag and drop your picture then the (childish) algorithm will remove the white to make it transparent. It works like a charm. Then you can save the picture with a right click.

Available on GitHub (what a surprise). It’s perfectible, for sure.
