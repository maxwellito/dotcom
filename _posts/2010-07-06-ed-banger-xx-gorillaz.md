description: When the Ed Banger crew meet Gorillaz. A mix of different music style
  I like.
intro: 'Gorillaz and Ed Banger records are musical movements I like. Jamie Hewlett
  is the drawer of the Gorillaz characters, and his work fascinates me, he created
  a real universe around this band. As I know myself, drawing character is not my
  cup of tea but I wanted to make this challenge: draw some characters of Ed Banger.
  At the start I wanted to recreate "la cene" of Da Vinci. But somebody did it before
  me : argg!! (by the way it''s SO_ME, Ed Rec Artistic Director, himself who told
  me that!). So I''ve search a good way to do my project and finally I''ve kept
  the Gorillaz style.<br>At the end, the result is much better than the start idea.'
