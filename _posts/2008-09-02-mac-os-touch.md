description: Animation of my vision of Mac OS if it was touch. A kind of concept
  with computers possibilities and iPhone ergonomics.
intro: 'On 2007, Apple introduced the iPhone. This little device who has changed
  a lot of things and our way to interact with internet. But the most surprising
  for me during the introduction was the interface. Something really simple, completely
  re-thinked. And I think I wasn''t the only one to dream about a bigger format.
  Something as big as a laptop screen. This is why in 2008, I enjoyed my Wacom tablet
  to make my first animation clip: my vision of Mac OS touch. This video is more
  about a list of good features to add on the current system than a general review
  of the graphic interface. In 2010, Apple introduced the iPad, and I was terribely
  disappointed to see exactly the same iOS as on iPhone.<br>This project makes me
  realised how long can take the creation of animation. It takes me several weeks
  to see the end of it.'
