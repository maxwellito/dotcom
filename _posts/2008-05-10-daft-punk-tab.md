  Imitating the best electronic music band has never been so easy. Because
  everybody is a Daft Punk, especially you..
intro:
  On 2008, the famous band Daft Punk made a live performance with Kanye West
  at the grammy awards ceremony. The show was visually amazing, but when the electronic
  band began to play, they used a touch screen controler with a really strange and
  futuristic interface. Everybody thought that was a fake, but no. These devices
  were real and called Lemur, made by the company JazzMutant. Like anybody, I wanted
  to try this, unfortunately, I don't know anybody who got this kind of controller.
  And I realised that I could do it in flash. Here is how I created my first sampler
  on flash. The samples come from the song 'Harder, better, faster, stronger'.<br><br><a
