Ok, from the start, this is absolutely silly but I had to make mock ups. It's therapautic, once done it can leave my mind.

JustEat and Grindr share a lot of common data: display data points related to your position, each point got a variable interest, in-between exchange is mandatory to continue, some points can be promoted.. Why not mix the two?

Anyway, this can also work with Tinder. Ignore the pizza once, get unmatched forever.
