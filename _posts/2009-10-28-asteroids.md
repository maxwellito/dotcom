description: Like many video game, the old game Asteroids needed its own movie poster.
intro: 'The idea came after seeing the TRON Legacy poster. I wanted to make a film
  poster about one of my favorite old game : asteroid, the famous Atari game. So
  I tried to make it as realist as possible. It was a good training on Illustrator,
  even if the work wasn''t very difficult.'
quote: Daft Punk made the music for TRON. Justice can make the music for Asteroids
