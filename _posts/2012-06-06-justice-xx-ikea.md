description: Tribute to the live performance of Justice. Re-creation of their light
  show with an IKEA library and a camera.
intro: 'One of my best accidental success. Let''s begin from the start, we are on
  the start of 2012 and I had the chance to see one of my favourite electronic band
  : Justice. The live show is very impressive, with a big light show. To explain,
  their stage is made with two little walls of 3x3 fake Marshall amplificators (full
  of LED for animations). Behind the stage a massive curtain of lights, stobe lights,
  and other lights. <br>After having moved to London, I had to buy some furnitures,
  whose a white IKEA library. Many week later I made the link between both, recreate
  the Justice live show with my library. But how ? I have no skill in electronic
  (even if I begin to take a look to Arduino). So I found the idea of stop-motion
  very interesting and easy to manipulate once on my computer. For the audio I used
  a live-rip found on soundcloud. <br>For the first time, the social network Behance
  put my project on featured on their Motion Graphics page. It''s nothing, but very
  surprising and pleasant.'
