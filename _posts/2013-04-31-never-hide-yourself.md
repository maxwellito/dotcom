description: Illustration made for a friend. It's a mix between two faces of differents
  characters.
intro: 'The idea behind this illustration was to mix two portraits from two defferents
  characters. One is the corporate guy, shy, close to be emotionless. The other
  is a big guy with tattoo, confident, manly. But behind these faces, we are hidding
  the real personality. And everybody does that. <br>About the realisation, my main
  focus was on the range of colors : using only a gradient. It sounds easy but it''s
  not for me, I have a lot of work to do about the colors, that''s my problem. To
  finish with this hand writted sentence in a vibrant red.'
quote: I used a lot of Illustrator masks to do this illustration. Ironic, isn't
  it ?
