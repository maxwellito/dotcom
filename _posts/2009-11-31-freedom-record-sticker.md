description: My first creation printed on stickers, to promote freedomrecord.fr
intro: End of 2009, my friend Remy Roches, owner a podcast about electronic music,
  talk to me about the idea to make stickers to promote his website. But he asked
  me make the design, of course I couldn't refuse. The idea to have one of my creation
  printed in one thousand copy, it's really exciting. Ok, today print stickers is
  cheap and easy to do, but it's enough to make me happy. After two or three mockup,
  the design was accepted. <br>This was my first print, and it was interesting to
  work with print conditions. For information, the podcast closed in 2012 for an
  other project called The Loop.<br>Once again, thanks Remy.
