subtitle: Harder, better, faster, stonger.

description: Imitating the best electronic music band has never been so easy. Because
  everybody is a Daft Punk, especially you..
intro: On 2008, the famous band Daft Punk made a live performance with Kanye West
  at the grammy awards ceremony. The show was visually amazing, but when the electronic
  band began to play, they used a touch screen controler with a really strange and
  futuristic interface. Everybody thought that was a fake, but no. These devices
  were real and called Lemur, made by the company JazzMutant. Like anybody, I wanted
  to try this, unfortunately, I don't know anybody who got this kind of controller.
  And I realised that I could do it in flash. Here is how I created my first sampler
  on flash. The samples come from the song 'Harder, better, faster, stronger'.<br><br><a

description: Animation of my vision of Mac OS if it was touch. A kind of concept
  with computers possibilities and iPhone ergonomics.
intro: 'On 2007, Apple introduced the iPhone. This little device who has changed
  a lot of things and our way to interact with internet. But the most surprising
  for me during the introduction was the interface. Something really simple, completely
  re-thinked. And I think I wasn''t the only one to dream about a bigger format.
  Something as big as a laptop screen. This is why in 2008, I enjoyed my Wacom tablet
  to make my first animation clip: my vision of Mac OS touch. This video is more
  about a list of good features to add on the current system than a general review
  of the graphic interface. In 2010, Apple introduced the iPad, and I was terribely
  disappointed to see exactly the same iOS as on iPhone.<br>This project makes me
  realised how long can take the creation of animation. It takes me several weeks
  to see the end of it.'

description: My first creation printed on stickers, to promote freedomrecord.fr
intro: End of 2009, my friend Remy Roches, owner a podcast about electronic music,
  talk to me about the idea to make stickers to promote his website. But he asked
  me make the design, of course I couldn't refuse. The idea to have one of my creation
  printed in one thousand copy, it's really exciting. Ok, today print stickers is
  cheap and easy to do, but it's enough to make me happy. After two or three mockup,
  the design was accepted. <br>This was my first print, and it was interesting to
  work with print conditions. For information, the podcast closed in 2012 for an
  other project called The Loop.<br>Once again, thanks Remy.

  a real universe around this band. As I know myself, drawing character is not my

  At the start I wanted to recreate "la cene" of Da Vinci. But somebody did it before
  me : argg!! (by the way it''s SO_ME, Ed Rec Artistic Director, himself who told
  me that!). So I''ve search a good way to do my project and finally I''ve kept
  the Gorillaz style.<br>At the end, the result is much better than the start idea.'

description: I can do something good from a deception, sometimes.
intro: Start of 2011, I sent some candidatures to digital agencies in London to
  see if I could get a chance to get a job. It was with a big surprise that one
  of my favourite contacted me and wanted to hire me. Unfortunately, because of
  my current contract I couldn't leave my job to accept it. <br>After this big deception,
  I created this illustration to express my mood. So finally, I can do something
  good from a deception.

intro: Since the poster of Sponge Bob, I wanted to continue on this idea but with
  something else; make posters of classical movies was the best thing to do. For
  each poster you have to know what object is iconic with the movie. And keeping
  a soviet style, a way between Shepard Fairey and USSR propaganda.

title: triangle
subtitle: The basis of everything
date: 1318024800
category: illustration
description: 'Series of illustrations made with triangles. '
intro: 'The idea was simple, working with the main shape : the triangle. At the
  start it was used to make the background of a simple flyer called "It''s always
  difficult to ask something important". The concept was easy to workout so I tried
  to take this to an other level: make the portrait of a friend (the FAITH illustration).
  For once I was happy to use a big range of colours; I used to stay on basic colours,
  or even no colour at all. It takes a lot of time to build something from a superposition
  of triangles. <br>The ''Justice'' illustration is monochrome (go back to the basics)
  and about my favourite band. Something simple, the color of the band and the atmosphere
  of their live performance'

description: Tribute to the live performance of Justice. Re-creation of their light
  show with an IKEA library and a camera.
intro: 'One of my best accidental success. Let''s begin from the start, we are on
  the start of 2012 and I had the chance to see one of my favourite electronic band
  : Justice. The live show is very impressive, with a big light show. To explain,
  their stage is made with two little walls of 3x3 fake Marshall amplificators (full
  of LED for animations). Behind the stage a massive curtain of lights, stobe lights,
  and other lights. <br>After having moved to London, I had to buy some furnitures,
  whose a white IKEA library. Many week later I made the link between both, recreate
  the Justice live show with my library. But how ? I have no skill in electronic
  (even if I begin to take a look to Arduino). So I found the idea of stop-motion
  very interesting and easy to manipulate once on my computer. For the audio I used
  a live-rip found on soundcloud. <br>For the first time, the social network Behance
  put my project on featured on their Motion Graphics page. It''s nothing, but very
  surprising and pleasant.'

intro: Three years after launching the first version, a full rebuild was necessary.
  Flash is not friendly anymore, damn S. Jobs. So to make this a challenge I took
  the opportunity to learn Symfony, the popular PHP framework. HTML5 and CSS3, media-query
  are used to make this website available for mobile. A little refresh of the 'branding'
  was necessary, but the logo stay's the same and will always stay the same.<br>Actually,
  we keep the same crazy guy behind, the weird projects and just change the design.
  And here is the new version.

description: Illustration made for a friend. It's a mix between two faces of differents
  characters.
intro: 'The idea behind this illustration was to mix two portraits from two defferents
  characters. One is the corporate guy, shy, close to be emotionless. The other
  is a big guy with tattoo, confident, manly. But behind these faces, we are hidding
  the real personality. And everybody does that. <br>About the realisation, my main
  focus was on the range of colors : using only a gradient. It sounds easy but it''s
  not for me, I have a lot of work to do about the colors, that''s my problem. To
  finish with this hand writted sentence in a vibrant red.'
