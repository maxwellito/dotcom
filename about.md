# About [me]

My name is Max.
Late 20s, living in London and try to remain hidden behind the avatar of maxwellito.
Software engineer during the day, maker of useless at night.

Passionate about code and visual (probably the reason I do front-end)
Curious about new areas were code can bring things to life to create new experiences.
Illustrator is my third hand.

Sorry for being another white male.
