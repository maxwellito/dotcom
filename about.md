# about://me

My name is Max.
Based in London and try to remain hidden behind the avatar of maxwellito.
Software engineer during the day, maker of useless at night.

Passionate about code and visual arts (probably the reason I do front-end)
Curious about new areas where code can bring things to life to create new experiences.
Illustrator is my third hand.
